# MapWatch
### A Path of Exile application that collects map drop data.


### Description:

*Map Watch* is an application that records map drops in the game Path of Exile.  Once enough data is collected it can show different statistics on the map drops recorded.  


### Use:

You can run the Python script in version 3.4 or download the full release that includes a Windows exe that any Windows PC should be able to run.  While in game the application will run in the background and it will popup once a player finds and copies a map's info to the clipboard.  To do this, simply highlight a map in your inventory and press Ctrl+C.  After that the application is pretty obvious I hope.


### Important Note:

It is highly recommended you play Path of Exile in a **Windowed Mode** while using this application.  Playing in Full Screen will cause problems that may lead to your death in game (i.e. the game might minimize).  Don't say I didn't warn you.
