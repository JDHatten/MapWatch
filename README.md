# MapWatch
### A Path of Exile application that collects map drop data.


### Description:
*Map Watch* is an application that records map drops in the game Path of Exile.  Once enough data is collected it can show different statistics on the map drops recorded via a local webpage.  


### Use:
You can run the Python script in version 3.4 or download the full release that includes a Windows exe that any Windows PC should be able to run.  While in game the application will run in the background and it will popup once a player finds and copies a map's info to the clipboard.  To do this, simply highlight a map in your inventory and press Ctrl+C.  

Once a map is selected you can choose to add it to your map drops or run it.  If you choose to run the map, all future map drops that you add will be linked to this map until you select map cleared.  Maps can also be added unlinked to any map currently running and removed (in order added) from the database.


### Important Note:
It is highly recommended you play Path of Exile in a **Windowed Mode** while using this application.  Playing in Full Screen will cause problems that may lead to your death in game (i.e. the game might minimize).  Don't say I didn't warn you.
